      <h3 >Introduction</h3>
      <p>On March 8, 2022, I got a call from my father and stepmother that my grandmother had passed away. This news was very shocking to me because I had just gone and seen my grandmother three weeks before her passing. Her death was sudden, and I was lost for words when I got the news. I didn’t have a strong relationship with my grandmother due to the fact that we lived ten hours away from each other but as I was getting older, I was slowly building my relationship with her. I would go visit every summer and sometimes during the holidays. My grandmother was a great woman, who loved her grandchildren and cooking of course. When I visited her before her passing, she made sure I had a good meal before I left for the airport. She made sure to call me for my birthday every year and sent me a birthday card. She and my grandpa loved traveling and going to their local casino in Cleveland. Knowing that my grandmother passed away doing something she loved surrounded by the people she adored helped me prepare for my trip to Ohio to lay her to rest. I had a week to get myself together and book my flight from IL to OH.  </p>
		<h3> Flight to Cleveland OH</h3>
      <p>I started my weekend trip from St. Louis to Cleveland on Thursday, March 17, 2022, it was a late flight leaving at 7:54 in the evening. This was a solo trip, and the flight was delayed. Plane rides are always so peaceful and relaxing to me. But for some reason during this flight, I was nervous and overwhelmed. The whole flight I was thinking about my grandma and what our relationship could have been. The happy and sad moments came to my mind. I took lots of pictures of the sky during the flight.</p>
		<h3> Day of Funeral </h3>
      <p>I landed in Cleveland around 11 pm and had to drive 45 mins to my father and stepmother’s house. Right when we arrived, I took a shower and went to sleep. Nine hours later, it was time for me to go lay my sweet grandma to rest. It was a day I wasn’t looking forward to because I didn’t know how I would handle it. It was a day that I would reunite with family I hadn’t seen in years and meet people I’d never met before. When I arrived at the funeral home my siblings were waiting for me so that we could all sit together. We cried together, shared memories, and took lots of photos. It was our first time getting a photo of me, my three siblings, and my dad all together. Although the reason we all came together was because of death it was still a very special moment that I will cherish forever </p>

      <h3 >How Effective is Music Therapy?</h3>
	  <h4><a href="#mtp" class="internallink">Techniques Used In Music Therapy </a></h4>
<p>You had a long day at work or school and it’s time for you to finally leave the setting you have
  been in for hours. You walk out of the building headed to your car to drive home and have a
  relaxed rest of your day. The first thing you hear when you turn on your car is your favorite
  song. The beat and lyrics bring you to ease and make you forget about the horrible dreadful day
  you had at work. The song is speaking to you and it’s helping you clear your mind and calm your
  soul. The definition of music is vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way
  as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion. The definition of therapy is
  the treatment of mental conditions through verbal communication and interaction.</p>
		<h4></h4>
      <p>Music therapy is a form of treatment that uses music to address the physical, emotional,
cognitive, and social needs of individuals. It has been shown to be effective in a variety of
settings, including hospitals, schools, and community centers, and with individuals of all ages.
Music therapy is the clinical, evidence-based use of musical treatments to meet certain goals in a
therapeutic setting by a qualified individual who has successfully completed a certified music
therapy program.</p>
			<h4></h4>
      <p>There have been numerous research studies conducted on the effectiveness of music therapy.
One such study, published in the book Music Therapy: An Art Beyond Words states that the
pleasure gained from listening; the warmth and friendship from being part of a group making
music; the stimulus and satisfaction from regular practice and rehearsal; the intellectual delight
from exploring the intricacies of musical forms and structures; the physical energy released
within us by both playing and listening to music, inspiring us often to move and dance.{1}
This source gives a background look at how music helps many different people and the things
they are battling. For example, Mental health. As stated in this source “Music helps us to feel
more human. It brings us into very close and immediate contact with the people around us and at
the same time connects us both with images from the past and predictions of the immediate
future.” {1}</p>
		<h4></h4>
<p>Other studies have also found that music therapy can be effective in improving communication
skills, reducing pain, and improving quality of life in individuals with various medical
conditions, such as cancer, stroke, and Parkinson&#39;s disease.</p>
		<h3 id="mtp"> Some common techniques used in music therapy include: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Improvisation: This involves creating music at the moment, without any prior planning or
preparation. It allows individuals to express themselves and explore their emotions in a
safe and non-judgmental environment.</li>
			<li>Songwriting: This involves writing and creating original songs, which can be used to
express feelings, share experiences, and communicate thoughts and ideas.</li>
			<li>Receptive music therapy: This involves listening to music in a structured way, and using
it as a tool for relaxation, stress reduction, and emotional expression.</li>
			<li>Instrumental music therapy: This involves playing musical instruments, either
individually or in a group, to achieve therapeutic goals.</li>
	  </ul>
			<h4></h4>
<p> Upon the research that was done on this topic, a source was read about a person named Jimmy
that used music therapy to heal his depression and cope with stress. Throughout the article, it
talks about how Music Therapy can be offered in many ways to help fit the client. A team was
put together to go over Jimmy’s diagnosis and came together to find the best solution for him.
Research showed that more people are open to going through music therapy than talking with a
therapist about their problems.</p>
		<h4></h4>
		
<p>Overall, the research suggests that music therapy can be a powerful and effective treatment for a
variety of physical and emotional conditions. If you are interested in learning more about the
research on music therapy, there are many sources you can find more information about it
through Google Scholar and other platforms. The research talked about in this paper was
supported by details and information that was relevant to this topic. This research has
demonstrated that there are many more ways than merely talking to someone to help cure your
mind and soul. When people think of therapy, they typically picture discussing their issues with a
therapist, but there are other approaches that might be helpful, like music therapy.</p>

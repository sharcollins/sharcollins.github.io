      <h3 >Favorite Brand</h3>
      <p>My favorite brand would have to be Skims. Skims is known for its underwear, loungewear, and shape wear that you can wear anywhere. Kim Kardashian is the owner of this brand, and it was launched in 2019. Skims collabs with many celebrities and other social media influencers that brings attraction to the brand. Skims is also very active on many different social media platforms for example, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter.  The first time I really heard about this brand was though the social media platform TikTok. One of the brands items gained a lot of attention and was trending on the platform. Skims website is also appealing and easy to navigate. Its simple and stands out from other websites.  When I went to go purchase the item on the site all I had to do was go to the “Best Sellers” tab and it was one of the first items to pop up. </p>
		<h3>Why Skims?</h3>
      <p>Skims gives use shoppers and easy access to buying their products. Not only is the website easy to navigate it is also nice to look at. The logo is fun and bold, and it stands out from other brands. The website also showcases different high-quality photos taken throughout campaigns and other collection releases. The primary colors used on the website is light brown and dark brown. The background is white making the font and colors pop on the page. The images used has vibrant lighting and simple details. </p>
		
	  <h3>What Do I Plan to Use?</h3>
		
      <p>I like the way Skims used only two similar colors through their website that limited it from clashing. I plan to use a font that is bold but not too dramatic. My font used for headings will be highlighted and have a background color. I plan on using Auberjean Regular by Abbyland because it is a similar font to the original, but I think this one stands out more. As for the body font I plan on using a San Serif font.  </p>
		
		<h3>My Logo Header</h3>
		
      <p>For the logo header, I plan on making it the main color of my website and having the size of the font be the biggest thing on the page. I want to make sure it stands out but its not too much. The colors I’m thinking about its dark purple and light purple. I don’t want my colors to be too light and clash so I may have to add in another accent color but I have decided on what it should be yet.   </p>
